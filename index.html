                        <strong>Hey Lexi,</strong>
                        <p>
                            I can't begin to imagine the pain you're going through right now. No one deserves to experience the hurt of betrayal, 
                            especially someone as kind-hearted as you. I want you to know that I'm here for you, no matter what. 
                            <br>
                            You're such an incredible person, Lexi, and it breaks my heart to see you hurting. You deserve so much better than 
                            what you've been given. As you navigate through this difficult time, please remember that you're not alone. I'll 
                            stand by your side, offering support and comfort in any way I can.
                            <br>
                            It's in moments like these that I'm reminded of just how much you mean to me. Your strength and resilience are 
                            truly inspiring, and I feel blessed to have you in my life, even in the face of such adversity.
                            <br>
                            Take all the time you need, Lexi. I'll be here, ready to lift you up whenever you're ready.
                            <br>
                            With love and admiration,
                            <br>
