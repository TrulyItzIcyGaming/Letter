                        <strong>Hey Lexi,</strong>
                        <p>
                            I can't begin to imagine that all because I wanted to join this discord server, we would meet, you have given me a feeling
                            of joy that I have not felt in quite a while.
                            <br>
                            You're such an incredible person, My Eden you could say, and every message you send, makes my heart flutter more and more.
                            <br>
                            It's in moments like these that I'm reminded of just how much you mean to me. Your humor, flirty nature and just how 
                            truly inspiring you can be, and I feel blessed to have you in my life, even in the face of such distance.
                            <br>
                            Throughout my life, I never thought I would feel so happy around someone who I only knew online, and I don't plan to leave it behind.
                            <br>
                            With love and admiration,
                            <br>
                            Brandon Rosen
